* **User-registered anniversaries** are personal anniversaries that each user can set once.

During celebration, the bot will search for your posts from the same date in the previous year and quote-repost it (if found) to reflect on old memories. Celebrating a user-registered anniversary also gifts you an **"Anniversary Badge (valid for 24 hours)"**.

You can register your user anniversary using the following steps:
